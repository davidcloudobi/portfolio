                Let’s be honest.
    
                Sometime throughout our coding careers, we’ve all found ourselves frustrated with centering things in CSS (looking up how to center a div within a div on Google or Stack Overflow).
                
                It can be one of the simplest tasks to do, but can quickly become confusing as you add more elements and styles into your page.
                
                Since it’s a pretty common problem, I’ve compiled a list of ways for centering in CSS into this guide. I’ve also included embeds/links with each example I created in CodePen. Feel free to fork, share, or copy as you wish!
